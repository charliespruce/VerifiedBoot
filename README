This is a the usage file for the scripts to set up verified boot, on Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 2.7.17 as the default path.

NOTE: Your SD card must be partioned into 2 partitions, 128MB boot partition (FAT16 memory, boot flag enabled) and the rest the root filesystem partition.

The usage is simple, traverse to this "scripts" directory and run "./main.sh path/to/SD/card". Don't run the script with sudo!
The scripts will set up a verified boot for the Raspberry Pi 3B+ SD you have pointed it to.


Instructions on how to format the SD:
fdisk /dev/sdx   # where sdx is the name of your sd-card
   > p             # prints partition table
   > d             # repeat until all partitions are deleted
   > n             # create a new partition
   > p             # create primary
   > 1             # make it the first partition
   > <enter>       # use the default sector
   > +128M         # create a boot partition with 128MB of space
   > n             # create rootfs partition
   > p
   > 2
   > <enter>
   > <enter>       # fill the remaining disk, adjust size to fit your needs
   > t             # change partition type
   > 1             # select first partition
   > e             # use type 'e' (FAT16)
   > a             # make partition bootable
   > 1             # select first partition
   > p             # double check everything looks right
   > w             # write partition table to disk.

The partition table should look something like this:
Device     Boot  Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sdx1  *      2048   145407   143360  128M  e W95 FAT16 (LBA)
/dev/sdx2       145408 31116287 30970880 14.8G 83 Linux

main.sh runs 4 scripts:
	- initialise.sh | downloads and configures Google repo tool (latest version), pulls in the OP-TEE manifest, and compiles the OP-TEE firmware
	- buildfit.sh | builds the "fit" directory, generates RSA keys (2048 bit) to sign image and creates the signed FIT image
	- rebuild.sh | rebuilds the OP-TEE firmware after configuring to accept our FIT image
	- format.sh | builds the boot and root filesystems on the SD, and copies over the FIT image and updated binaries

2 folders will be created in the user's home directory, "devel" and "bin".
To test, run a listener such as minicom or picocom, 115200 bit rate on the correct tty device.
